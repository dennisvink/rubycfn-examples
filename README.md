# Rubycfn Examples

These are examples used by the [RubyCfn CloudFormation Compiler](https://rubycfn.com).
You can use these examples locally as well in the following way:

`gem install rubycfn`
`git clone https://github.com/dennisvink/rubycfn-examples.git`
`cd rubycfn-examples`
`cat "1. Creating an S3 Bucket.rb" | rubycfn`

The above command will output the CloudFormation template to STDOUT.
